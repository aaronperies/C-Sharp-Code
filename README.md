# C-Sharp-Code
All programs and tutorials written using C# will be in here

I created this repository so that the public will have any access to the code I've written in C#
especially for tutorials that have extensive comments.

There may or may not be a private branch in the repository as well which will contain more
sensitive code either written for professional usage or personal use.

Happy coding everyone!
